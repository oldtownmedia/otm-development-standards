# OTM Development Standards

## Development Standards for Old Town Media

The point of these documents is to identify a common set of syntax and instructions for writing code at Old Town Media. Our goal is to establish a standard well-above the local, small agency and push ourselves to the next level. We use these standards on a daily basis in every site that we work on and hope that you will as well. We have taken the time to push this publicly and open-source as proof of our commitment to quality.
