<p>The point of these documents is to identify a common set of syntax and instructions for writing code at Old Town Media. Our goal is to establish a standard well-above the local, small agency and push ourselves to the next level. We use these standards on a daily basis in every site that we work on and hope that you will as well. We have taken the time to push this publicly and open-source as proof of our commitment to quality.</p>

<h4>Attribution</h4>
<p>While these pages reflect our stylization and standards, we have borrowed heavily from the industry leaders in standards. These companies deserve credit for taking the lead in their respective industries and publishing their standards open-source.</p>
