<div class="home">

<p>The point of these documents is to identify a common set of syntax and instructions for writing code at Old Town Media. The point isn't to be restrictive about how you write code - but simply to hold ourselves to a higher standard. It is infinitely easier to have a previously-agreed ethos and stylization than to jump into a project and try and read someone else's syntax.</p>

<p>It also increases the quality of our code and gives an easier on-boarding to developers down the road.</p>
